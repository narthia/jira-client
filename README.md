# @narthia/jira-client

A Jira API client with dual ESM/CJS support, designed for both standard Jira REST API and Atlassian Forge applications. **This project is 100% written in TypeScript** with comprehensive type definitions and zero runtime dependencies for standard usage.

## Features

- üöÄ **TypeScript First**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- üîÑ **Dual Client Support**: Works with both standard Jira REST API and Atlassian Forge
- üì¶ **Modern Packaging**: ESM and CommonJS dual support
- üõ°Ô∏è **Type Safe**: Fully typed API responses and requests
- ‚ö° **Zero Dependencies**: No runtime dependencies for standard Jira REST API usage. `@forge/api` is an optional peer dependency only needed for Forge apps

## Installation

```bash
npm install @narthia/jira-client
```

## Quick Start

### Standard Jira REST API Client

```typescript
import { JiraClient } from "@narthia/jira-client";

const client = new JiraClient({
  type: "default",
  auth: {
    email: "your-email@example.com",
    apiToken: "your-api-token",
    baseUrl: "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
  },
});

// Get an issue
const issue = await client.issue.get({
  pathParams: { issueKeyOrId: "PROJ-123" },
  queryParams: { fields: "summary,description,status" },
});

if (issue.success) {
  console.log(issue.data.fields.summary);
}
```

### Atlassian Forge Client

```typescript
import { JiraClient } from "@narthia/jira-client";
import api from "@forge/api";

const client = new JiraClient({
  type: "forge",
  auth: { api },
});

// Get an issue in Forge context
const issue = await client.issue.get({
  pathParams: { issueKeyOrId: "PROJ-123" },
  opts: { as: "app" }, // by default its user
});

if (issue.success) {
  console.log(issue.data.fields.summary);
}
```

## API Reference

### Method Parameters

Most client methods accept an options object with the following properties:

- **`pathParams`**: An object containing variables to be substituted into the URL path. For example, `{ issueKeyOrId: "PROJ-123" }` will replace the corresponding placeholder in the endpoint path.
- **`queryParams`**: An object representing URL query string parameters. For example, `{ fields: "summary,description" }` will be serialized as `?fields=summary,description`.
- **`body`**: The request payload for methods that send data (such as POST, PUT, PATCH). For example, `{ fields: { summary: "New summary" } }`.
- **`opts`**: Additional options for the request. This may include:
  - **`as`**: For Forge apps, requests are made as the user by default, but you can set to `"app"` to act as the app instead of the user.
  - **`headers`**: An object of custom HTTP headers to include in the request (e.g., `{ "X-Custom-Header": "value" }`).

#### Default Headers

By default, the client sets the following headers for all requests:

- `Accept`: `application/json`
- `Content-Type`: `application/json` (for requests with a body)

> **Experimental Endpoints:** For Jira Cloud endpoints that require experimental API access, the client automatically sets the `X-ExperimentalApi: opt-in` header. This header is only sent when needed for such endpoints.

> **Authorization:** The `Authorization` header is set automatically based on your authentication method (API token) only for the `default` client type. It is not used for Forge apps.

You can override or add additional headers using the `opts.headers` option.

#### Example Usage

```typescript
// Get an issue with path and query parameters
const issue = await client.issue.get({
  pathParams: { issueKeyOrId: "PROJ-123" },
  queryParams: { fields: "summary,description,status" },
});

// Create an issue with a request body
const created = await client.issue.create({
  body: {
    fields: {
      project: { key: "PROJ" },
      summary: "New issue",
      issuetype: { name: "Task" },
    },
  },
});

// Use 'as' in opts for Forge-specific options
// In Atlassian Forge apps, requests are made as the user by default.
// If you want to perform the request as the app (with app-level permissions),
// pass opts: { as: "app" }.
// This is useful for operations that require app-level access or automation.
const issueForge = await client.issue.get({
  pathParams: { issueKeyOrId: "PROJ-123" },
  opts: { as: "app" },
});

// Add custom headers using opts.headers
const issueWithHeaders = await client.issue.get({
  pathParams: { issueKeyOrId: "PROJ-123" },
  opts: {
    headers: {
      "X-Custom-Header": "my-value",
    },
  },
});
```

### Client Configuration

#### Default Jira Config

```typescript
interface DefaultJiraConfig {
  type: "default";
  auth: {
    email: string;
    apiToken: string;
    baseUrl: string;
  };
}
```

#### Forge Jira Config

```typescript
interface ForgeJiraConfig {
  type: "forge";
  auth: {
    api: ForgeAPI;
  };
}
```

### Type Definitions

The package exports comprehensive TypeScript definitions for all Jira entities:

- `Issue` - Complete issue object with all fields
- `User` - User information
- `Project` - Project information
- `Status` - Status information
- `IssueType` - Issue type information
- And more...

### Roadmap

We are actively expanding the client to cover the entire Jira Cloud REST API. More endpoints and services will be added in future releases, including:

- Comments and worklogs
- Attachments and avatars
- Users and groups
- Permissions and security
- Workflows and transitions
- And much more...

Stay tuned for regular updates as we continue to build out the complete Jira API client!

## Error Handling

The client provides robust error handling with typed responses:

```typescript
const issue = await client.issue.get({
  pathParams: { issueKeyOrId: "PROJ-123" },
});

if (issue.success) {
  // Handle successful response
  console.log(issue.data.fields.summary);
} else {
  // Handle error
  console.error("Error:", issue.error);
  console.log("Status:", issue.status);
}
```
